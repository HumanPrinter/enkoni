      Comment: Splitted the Enkoni.Framework.Entities into four seperate projects. Enkoni.Framework.Entities contains the general data-access classes,
               Enkoni.Framework.Entities.Database contains the classes use a database as datasource for the data-access, 
               Enkoni.Framework.Entities.File contains classes that use a file as datasource for the data-access,
               Enkoni.Framework.Entities.Service contains classes that use a WCF service as datasource for the data-access.
               By splitting these classes into seperate projects, developers no longer need to include WCF-related libraries when they only want to
               use a database or include database-related libraries when they only want to use a filebased datasource. The memory-based data-access 
               classes are still a part of the Enkoni.Framework.Entities project since they don't require any additional and/or memory-specific 
               libraries nor is it to be expected that they will need to in the future.
