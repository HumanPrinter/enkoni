  Enkoni.Framework.Entities (1.0.0.0)
  [*] Splitted the Enkoni.Framework.Entities project into four seperate projects
      Date:    2011-02-24
      Comment: Splitted the Enkoni.Framework.Entities into four seperate projects. Enkoni.Framework.Entities contains the general data-access classes,
               Enkoni.Framework.Entities.Database contains the classes use a database as datasource for the data-access, 
               Enkoni.Framework.Entities.File contains classes that use a file as datasource for the data-access,
               Enkoni.Framework.Entities.Service contains classes that use a WCF service as datasource for the data-access.
               By splitting these classes into seperate projects, developers no longer need to include WCF-related libraries when they only want to
               use a database or include database-related libraries when they only want to use a filebased datasource. The memory-based data-access 
               classes are still a part of the Enkoni.Framework.Entities project since they don't require any additional and/or memory-specific 
               libraries nor is it to be expected that they will need to in the future.

  Enkoni.Framework.Logging (1.0.0.0)
  [+] Added the Enkoni.Framework.Logging project
      Date:    2011-02-23

               Block which is part of the Microsoft Enterprise Library.
