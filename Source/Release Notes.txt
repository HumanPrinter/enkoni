Version X.X.X.X
  OscarBrouwer.Framework (X.X.X.X)
  [*] CsvSerializer now also supports (de)serializing of partial CSV-records
      Date:    2011-01-04
      Comment: The CsvSerializer now is also able to (de)serialize objects that only map to some of the CSV-records. This way it is possible to
               create a type that only contains some of the fields that are available in the CSV-file and to use that type to (de)serialize the 
               information.
  
  [*] Fixed a bug in LambdaEqualityComparer when comparing objects on a multi-level property
      Date:    2011-01-09
      Comment: Fixed a bug that caused the LambdaEqualityComparer to return 'true' instead of 'false' when comparing two objects based on a multi-level
               property and one (not both) object has a null-value for that property.

  [*] Rewrote the Specification subsystem
      Date:    2011-01-12
      Comment: The Specification subsystem has been rewritten entirely to allow for a more flexible and functional usage.

  [+] Added a new extension method to remove an item from an ICollection<T>
      Date:    2011-01-07
      Comment: Added a new extension method that can be used to remove an item from an ICollection<T> using an IEqualityComparer<T> to look for
               the correct item that must be removed.

  [+] Added three new extension methods to find the index of an item in a (I)List<T>
      Date:    2011-01-07
      Comment: Added three new extension methods that can be used to find the index of an item in a (I)List<T> using an IEqualityComparer<T>.

  OscarBrouwer.Framework.Entities (X.X.X.X)
  [*] Upgraded the required .NET Frameworkversion
      Date:    2011-01-03
      Comment: The 'OscarBrouwer.Framework.Entities' project now requires the use of .NET Framework version 4, since it references the Entity
               Framework Code-First CTP version 5.

  [+] Added the IDatabaseRepository interface and DatabaseRepository & ShallowDatabaseRepository classes
      Date:    2011-01-03
      Comment: Added the 'IDatabaseRepository' interface and the 'DatabaseRepository' and the 'ShallowDatabaseRepository' classes, that implement 
               a repository that uses a database as its datasource. The classes are renamed versions of the 'IEntityFrameworkRepository' interface
               and 'EntityFrameworkRepository' and 'ShallowEntityFrameworkRepository' classes from the 'OscarBrouwer.Framework.Entities.EntityFramework'
               project. These classes are now renamed and added to the global 'OscarBrouwer.Framework.Entities' project since from this point forward
               only one ORM-technique will be supported. This will be the EntityFramework Code First. The project currently uses version CTP5 of
               this technology.
  
  [+] Added the abstract ServiceRepository class
      Date:    2011-01-03
      Comment: Added the abstract ServiceRepository class that can be used as a base class for any repository that uses a WCF-service as datasource.
  
  [+] Added the EntityEqualityComparer<T> class
      Date:    2011-01-07
      Comment: Added the EntityEqualityComparer<T> class which is a subclass of LambdaEqualityComparer<T, U> and provides a default equality-comparer
               that uses the RecordId to compare entities.
                                                           
  [+] Added the abstract FileRepository class and the concrete CsvFileRepository and XmlFileRepository classes
      Date:    2011-01-08
      Comment: Added the abstract FileRepository class that can be used as a base class for any repository that uses a file as datasource. The added concrete 
               classes CsvFileRepository and XmlFileRepository implement the FileRepository so that it can be used to read or write CSV or XML files.

  [+] Added the MemoryRepository class
      Date:    2011-01-08
      Comment: Added the MemoryRepository class that can be used to retrieve entities from and store entities in memory. It uses an instance of the new 
               MemoryStore class to determine where the entities must be stored in memory. Currently, there are two pre-configured options, using a static
               collection (through the StaticMemoryStore class) or using an HttpSession (using the HttpSessionMemoryStore class).

  [+] Added the DataSourceInfo and various helpfull descendants
      Date:    2011-01-08
      Comment: Added the DataSourceInfo class and some helpfull descendants that are used to pass datasource-specific information to the various 
      repositories.

  OscarBrouwer.Framework.Testing (X.X.X.X)
  [+] Added the HttpContextHelper and SimulatedHttpRequest classes
      Date:    2011-01-16
      Comment: Added the HttpContextHelper and SimulatedHttpRequest classes that can be used to simulate an Http session. This can be usefull when
               testing functionality that depends on an existing HTTP-session inside a testing environment that does not have one.

  [-] Removed the EntityFramework project
      Date:    2011-01-03

               Entity Framework. The contents of this project have been renamed from '*EntityFrameworkRepository' to '*DatabaseRepository' and added
               to the global 'OscarBrouwer.Framework.Entities' project.

  OscarBrouwer.Framework.Entities.LinqToSql.v3.5 (2.0.0.0)
  [-] Removed the LinqToSql.v3.5 project
      Date:    2011-01-03
      Comment: Completely removed the LinqToSql.v3.5 project. It is very unpracticle the maintain two different ORM-technologies especially 
               since LinqToSql is about to become obsolete in favor of the Entity Framework. Therefore, this framework will no longer support
               LinqToSql but only EntityFramework for database communication.
  
  OscarBrouwer.Framework.Entities.LinqToSql.v4.0 (2.0.0.0)

               LinqToSql but only EntityFramework for database communication.

  OscarBrouwer.Framework.Testing (X.X.X.X)
  [*] Upgraded the required .NET Frameworkversion
      Date:    2011-01-03
      Comment: The 'OscarBrouwer.Framework.Testing' project now requires the use of .NET Framework version 4, since it references the

      Date:    2010-11-23
