  [-] Removed the obsolete CsvFileSourceInfo class
      Date:    2012-11-24
      Comment: 
                Removed the obsolete CsvFileSourceInfo. Since this class was marked obsolete over a year ago and there is also
                 a breaking change scheduled for the Enkoni.Framework project, this seemes like a good moment to remove this class.

  [-] Removed the FlatWsdlBehavior classes
      Date:    2012-11-26
      Comment: 
                - Removed the FlatWsdlBehaviorExtensionElement and FlatWsdlBehaviorAttribute classes. The functionality did not always
                 behave as expected. Since .Net 4.5 has build-in support for generating a single WSDL file, this functionality is no longer required 
                 and therefore it was removed from this framework. When using .NET 4.5, it is recommended to use the new ?singlewsdl quierystring.
                 When using an earlier version of .NET, it is recommended to use the single WSDL functionality provided by the WCFExtras-library
                 which can be found at http://wcfextras.codeplex.com.
              

  [-] Removed the DisposableServiceBehaviorAttribute class
      Date:    2012-11-26
      Comment: 
                - New understanding of the WCF framework and more extensive unit testing learned that the disposable service behavior has 
                 been quite useless from the beginning. If the service implementation needs disposing, use a bindingtype and behavior that supports 
                 sessions. That way, the .NET ecosystem will automatically call the Dispose method upon session ending or channel faulting.

                 Therefore, a protected virtual method called FindEntityByIdCore method has been added. By default this method works just as the previous releases. Override

  Enkoni.Framework.Entities (1.0.0.0)
  [*] Splitted the Enkoni.Framework.Entities project into four seperate projects.
      Date:    2011-02-24
      Comment: Splitted the Enkoni.Framework.Entities into four seperate projects. Enkoni.Framework.Entities contains the general data-access classes,
                     Enkoni.Framework.Entities.Database contains the classes use a database as datasource for the data-access, 
                     Enkoni.Framework.Entities.File contains classes that use a file as datasource for the data-access,
                     Enkoni.Framework.Entities.Service contains classes that use a WCF service as datasource for the data-access.
                     By splitting these classes into seperate projects, developers no longer need to include WCF-related libraries when they only want to
                     use a database or include database-related libraries when they only want to use a filebased datasource. The memory-based data-access 
                     classes are still a part of the Enkoni.Framework.Entities project since they don't require any additional and/or memory-specific 
                     libraries nor is it to be expected that they will need to in the future.

  Enkoni.Framework.Logging (1.0.0.0)
